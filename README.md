# springboot-league

## Purpose
The root purpose was to have first try at a proper Java web app, without an externally predefined task.
The idea for the app was to buil a league management system to manage the results of matches between a set of teams.

The user actions and resposibilites would include:
- registration of teams
- look up their league standings
- look up their matches
- input the results of their matches

The actions and resposibilites of admins would include:
- registration of season rulesets, concerning the reward of win/draw/loss
- management of teams enrolled in a season
- registration of matches between teams
- supervision input results 

On top of this 'business logic', I wanted to have a user management system with registration, login, logout and different roles. And below a database to handle whatever persistent data would arise.
